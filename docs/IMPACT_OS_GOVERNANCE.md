## 1. Foundational Thesis

### The Problem

Poverty persists not due to lack of intelligence, ambition, or effort—but because systems fail to convert human potential into sustainable income.

**Traditional interventions fail because they:**

| Intervention | Structural Limitation |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Welfare & Aid | Temporary relief, no trajectory shift |
| Education Alone | Skills without income decay |
| Training Programs | Measure attendance, not outcomes |
| Job Placement | Fails in job-scarce economies |
| Microfinance | Debt without earning capacity |

### The Cycle28 Position

> **Poverty is not inevitable. It is systemic—and therefore can be systematically solved.**

**Three foundational truths:**

1. **Skills—when complete—are a permanent exit from poverty**
2. **Income is the only credible proof of transformation**
3. **Systems—not individuals—must carry the burden of enforcement**

---

## 2. What Impact OS Is (and Is Not)

### Impact OS IS

- A **behavioral operating system**
- A **conversion engine** (effort → income)
- An **enforcement layer** for dignity-preserving accountability
- A **measurement system** for real transformation

### Impact OS IS NOT

- A learning management system
- A task tracker
- A motivational app
- A content platform
- A social network

> **Principle:** Humans teach. Systems enforce.

---

## 3. Target Population

Impact OS explicitly targets individuals who:

- ✅ Have **no marketable skills**
- ✅ Have **little or no income**
- ✅ Are **trapped in survival mode**
- ✅ Lack confidence, articulation, and exposure
- ✅ Have never been taught how income is created

**Selection is NOT based on:**

- ❌ Polish or presentation
- ❌ English fluency
- ❌ Prior experience
- ❌ Confidence theater

**Selection IS based on:**

- ✅ Readiness to act once blockers are removed

---

## 4. Who This Is NOT For

Impact OS explicitly rejects applicants who:

- Seek guaranteed job placement
- Want certificates without income
- Are unwilling to face rejection
- Cannot commit to daily action
- Expect rescue without effort

> **System Position:** Strong systems need clear edges.

---

## 5. The Catalyst Definition

**Catalyst (n):** A graduate of Project 3:10 who has earned real, verified income from their skill before Day 90 and is equipped to multiply impact.

### A Catalyst:

- Earns independently
- Understands value creation
- Operates confidently in markets
- Transfers skills to others
- Creates compounding economic impact

> **Catalysts are not beneficiaries. They are economic agents.**

---

## 6. Project 3:10 — The 90-Day Model

### Name Meaning

- **3 Months** — Fixed, disciplined cycle
- **10× Impact** — Income + confidence + capability
- **One Catalyst at a Time** — Depth over vanity scale

### Core Program Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Survival Stabilization** | Monthly stipends remove survival pressure (not create dependency) |
| **Skills Training** | Market-driven digital skills taught from zero |
| **Mentorship** | 1-on-1 guidance from active practitioners |
| **Market Exposure** | Outreach, pitching, rejection, selling are mandatory |
| **Income Enforcement** | Graduation requires verified income before Day 90 |

### Program Cadence

- Quarterly cohorts
- Fixed annual calendar
- 6–8 weeks training + market sprint
- 90-day total cycle

---

## 7. The Skill Triad Framework

Impact OS teaches **complete skills**, not partial capabilities.

```
        TECHNICAL
           /\
          /  \
         /    \
        /      \
       /________\
    SOFT        COMMERCIAL
```

### The Triad Explained

| Skill Dimension | Alone, You Become |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Technical Only | Specialist, poor earner |
| Soft Only | Likeable, nothing to sell |
| Commercial Only | Hustler, no product |

### The Formula

> **Technical + Soft + Commercial = Catalyst**

### Assessment Model

Each participant sees a **live Skill Triangle** showing:

- Current proficiency in each dimension
- Imbalance alerts
- Blocking thresholds

**Graduation requires threshold completion on ALL THREE dimensions.**

### Skill Triad Scoring

```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each dimension is assessed through:

| Dimension | Assessment Method |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Technical | Practical execution challenges, portfolio review |
| Soft | Communication tasks, client simulation, peer feedback |
| Commercial | Outreach attempts, pitch delivery, negotiation exercises |

---

## 9. User Roles & Access Model

### The 4 Human User Categories

| Role | Type | Core Function |
|------|------|---------------|
| **Participant (Player)** | Human | Acts, fails, earns |
| **Mentor / Instructor** | Human | Teaches, guides |
| **Admin / Operator** | Human | Operates system |
| **Impact Officer (M&E)** | Human | Measures outcomes |

### The System Actor

| Role | Type | Core Function |
|------|------|---------------|
| **System (AI + Rules Engine)** | Non-human | Enforces behavior |

### Role Details

#### Participant (Player)

- No prior skills or income required
- Progresses through identity levels
- Completes missions
- Earns currencies
- Submits income proof

#### Mentor / Instructor

- Reviews escalations only
- Unlocks paths
- Intervenes when system flags risk
- **Does NOT:** Track attendance, police behavior, decide graduation, control stipends

#### Admin / Program Operator

- Manages cohorts
- Oversees stipends (within system rules)
- Reviews income verification
- Monitors system health
- **Constraint:** Cannot override core laws without audit trails

#### Impact Officer (M&E)

- Monitors impact metrics
- Analyzes conversion rates
- Validates reports for funders
- Audits outcomes and integrity
- **Does NOT:** Teach, mentor, intervene in behavior

---

## 10. Identity Progression System

Participants are **never labeled "students."** They progress through identity states:

| Level | Identity | Unlock Condition |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| L0 | Applicant | Intake submitted |
| L1 | Initiate | Onboarding completed |
| L2 | Builder | Skill missions started |
| L3 | Operator | Market exposure begun |
| L4 | Earner | Income verified |
| L5 | Catalyst | Graduation achieved |

> Identity level is **always visible in UI**.

---

## 11. Game Currencies (Behavioral)

Impact OS uses **four currencies**, each tied to real-world behavior.

### Momentum ⚡

- **Type:** Consistency currency
- **Earned by:** Showing up daily
- **Behavior:** Decays with inactivity
- **Property:** Cannot be faked

### Skill XP 🛠️

- **Type:** Capability currency
- **Earned by:** Execution of skill tasks
- **Behavior:** Track-specific
- **Property:** Unlocks harder missions

### Arena Points 🏟️

- **Type:** Failure & courage currency
- **Earned by:** Outreach, rejection, exposure
- **Behavior:** Never earned for planning
- **Property:** Proof of being "in the arena"

### Income Proof 💰

- **Type:** Truth currency
- **Earned by:** Single verified income event
- **Behavior:** Issued once, irreversible
- **Property:** Ends the core game loop, triggers graduation

---

## 12. Mission Engine

Impact OS **never presents "to-do lists."** Everything is a **Mission**.

### Mission Structure

Each mission MUST contain:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Context** | Why it matters |
| **Action** | Required real-world action |
| **Difficulty** | Level tag |
| **Reward** | Preview of currency gain |
| **Failure Consequence** | What happens if skipped |

### Mission Example

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  MISSION: First Outreach                                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Context: "Your skill means nothing until someone knows     │
│            about it. This mission proves you can be seen."  │
│                                                             │
│  Action: Contact 3 real people offering your service        │
│                                                             │
│  Difficulty: ★★☆☆☆                                         │
│                                                             │
│  Reward: +20 Arena Points 🏟️                               │
│                                                             │
│  Failure: Momentum decay (-10 ⚡)                           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Mission Rules

- No optional missions in core loop
- At least one mission active at all times
- Missions cannot be skipped

---

## 13. Failure Classification System

### System Position on Failure

> **Failure ≠ Inaction. Inaction is the only unacceptable state.**

This is **enforced in code**, not culture.

### Failure Taxonomy

| Failure Type | Meaning | System Response |
|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Market Rejection** | Explicit "no" from prospect | +Arena Points, log insight |
| **Non-Response** | No reply to outreach | Adjust channel strategy |
| **Offer Declined** | Pricing/value mismatch | Pricing mission triggered |
| **Missed Deadline** | Capacity issue | Time management intervention |
| **Avoidance** | No attempt made | Warning + escalation |
| **Burnout Dip** | Engagement drop pattern | Survival check triggered |

### Failure Logging Triggers

When failure is logged:

1. Award Arena Points (for exposure-based failures)
2. Generate micro-reflection prompt
3. Adjust mission difficulty if needed
4. Update predictive models

> **Failure is data, not shame.**

---

## 14. Stipend Governance

### Core Principle

> **Stipends are not welfare. They are targeted infrastructure.**

### Stipend Types (Power-Ups)

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Data Boost** | Internet access for learning |
| **Transport Pass** | Physical access when needed |
| **Tool Access** | Software/hardware access |

### Stipend Rules

```python
IF action_logged:
    stipend_active = True
ELSE:
    stipend_active = False
```

- Power-ups expire
- Power-ups require activity
- Inactivity disables them automatically
- No manual overrides without audit log

### Stipend Boundaries

- Stipends are capped **below local minimum wage**
- Stipends are **insufficient for comfort but sufficient for focus**
- Stipends **cannot replace income—only enable earning**

> **📖 For detailed budget management, approval tiers, disbursement flows, and audit requirements, see [Support Wallet Module](./SUPPORT_WALLET.md).**

### Decision Logic

## 15. Intake & Admissions Logic

### Intake Philosophy

> **Forms are diagnostic instruments, not storytelling spaces.**

### Intake Design Principles

- Extract signal, not performance
- Avoid fluency bias (text fields capped)
- Expose gaps, not polish
- Predict conversion probability

### Intake Sections

1. **Eligibility & Constraints** (non-scoring)
2. **Single Skill Declaration**
3. **Technical Action Probe**
4. **Commercial Clarity Probe**
5. **Market Exposure Probe**
6. **Accountability Consent**

### Admission Flow

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    ADMISSION PIPELINE                        │

│                                                              │
│   1. Self-Selection Assessment                               │
│      └─> Filters unserious applicants before application     │
│                                                              │
│   2. Structured Intake                                       │
│      └─> Action-based prompts (not essays)                   │
│                                                              │
│   3. AI Diagnostic Scoring                                   │
│      └─> Scores READINESS, not language quality              │
│                                                              │
│   4. Admission Decision                                      │
│      ├─> ADMIT (ready to act)                                │
│      ├─> CONDITIONAL ADMIT (needs intervention)              │
│      └─> REJECT (not ready)                                  │
│                                                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### AI Scoring Logic

The AI evaluates:

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Need Level | 20% | Survival pressure indicators |
| Readiness Signal | 40% | Response to leverage, not polish |
| Constraint Clarity | 20% | Awareness of blockers |
| Action Orientation | 20% | Evidence of prior attempts |

> **Core Question:** When blockers are removed, does this person move?

---

## 16. Earn-Before-Day-90 Rule

### The Rule (Non-Negotiable)

> Every participant must earn verified income from their skill before Day 90.

### Accepted Income

- ✅ Freelance services
- ✅ One-off client work
- ✅ Retainers
- ✅ Content payments
- ✅ Platform earnings (Fiverr, Upwork, etc.)

### NOT Accepted

- ❌ Mock clients
- ❌ Internal payments (Cycle28 paying participants)
- ❌ Unrelated hustles (not skill-based)
- ❌ Gifts or loans disguised as payment

### Income Requirements

Income must be:

- **Real** — Actual money transferred
- **Skill-based** — Directly tied to trained skill
- **Externally verified** — Proof from outside party

---

## 17. Income Verification Protocol

### Accepted Proof Types

| Proof Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Payment Receipt | Screenshot/PDF of transfer |
| Platform Confirmation | Fiverr, Upwork, PayPal notification |
| Client Acknowledgment | Written confirmation (redacted for privacy) |
| Bank Statement Entry | Matching transaction |

### Verification States

```
SUBMITTED → UNDER REVIEW → VERIFIED / REJECTED
```

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Submitted | Proof uploaded, awaiting review |
| Under Review | Admin examining evidence |
| Verified | Income confirmed, Earner status unlocked |
| Rejected | Proof insufficient, resubmission required |

> **Only "Verified" triggers Earner status (L4).**

---

## 18. AI & Rules Engine

### AI Responsibilities

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Intake Scoring | Classify readiness, not polish |
| Failure Classification | Auto-tag failure types |
| Mission Personalization | Adjust to participant state |
| Risk Detection | Flag disengagement patterns |
| Difficulty Tuning | Calibrate challenge level |
| Analytics Generation | Produce reports automatically |

### AI Restrictions (Hard Rules)

| AI Does NOT | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| Motivate emotionally | Preserves system neutrality |
| Override rules | Prevents favoritism |
| Make exceptions | Ensures audit integrity |
| Decide graduation | Income is the only proof |

> **AI acts as a neutral referee. Nothing more.**

---

## 19. Analytics & Measurement

### Core Behavioral Metrics

| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Action Rate** | Daily engagement frequency |
| **Arena Exposure** | Discomfort tolerance (rejection count) |
| **Iteration Velocity** | Speed of learning from failure |
| **Avoidance Frequency** | Risk indicator (no-attempt rate) |
| **Conversion Probability** | Predicted likelihood of income |
| **Time-to-First-Income** | Primary success KPI |

### Program-Level Impact Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| % earning before Day 90 | Primary KPI |
| Median time to income | Efficiency measure |
| Income repeatability | Sustainability check |
| Skill triad balance | Quality of transformation |
| Post-program earning retention | Long-term success |

### Failure Analytics (Differentiator)

Impact OS tracks:

- Rejection counts
- Outreach streaks
- Iteration loops
- Resilience after setbacks

> This allows predicting success **earlier than income**.

---

## 20. Abuse Resistance & Integrity

### Known Attack Vectors

| Vector | Risk |
|--------|------|
| Fake income | Fabricated payment screenshots |
| Gaming missions | Completing without learning |
| Stipend farming | Minimal action to collect support |
| Collusion | Participants "paying" each other |

### Safeguards

| Protection | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| External verification | Income must come from outside Cycle28 ecosystem |
| Decay mechanics | Currencies decay without real action |
| Behavior patterns | AI detects anomalous activity |
| Audit trails | Every action, decision, and override is logged |
| Cross-validation | Multiple proof types required for large claims |
| Random sampling | Periodic deep verification of random participants |

### Audit Logging

Every system action creates an immutable log entry:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-01-28T14:30:00Z",
  "actor": "system|admin|participant",
  "action": "stipend_approved|income_verified|mission_completed",
  "target": "participant_id",
  "evidence": "proof_reference",
  "override": false
}
```

---

## 21. System Rhythms

### Daily Rhythm (5–15 minutes)

- ✅ Check-in required
- ✅ One mandatory action
- ✅ Immediate feedback

### Weekly Rhythm

- ✅ Technical challenge
- ✅ Market challenge
- ✅ Reflection prompt
- ✅ Progress visualization

### System Rule

> The system **never asks** what users feel like doing.  
> It asks what they **did**.

---

## 22. Graduation Logic

### Graduation Requirements (All Required)

| Requirement | Verification |
|-------------|--------------|
| Verified income | Income Proof 💰 earned |

## 24. Alignment with SDGs

Impact OS directly advances United Nations Sustainable Development Goals:

| SDG | Alignment |
|-----|-----------|
| **SDG 1 — No Poverty** | Sustainable income pathways replace dependency |
| **SDG 4 — Quality Education** | Skills linked directly to economic outcomes |
| **SDG 8 — Decent Work & Economic Growth** | Catalysts enter the global digital economy |
| **SDG 10 — Reduced Inequalities** | Global work access regardless of geography |
| **SDG 17 — Partnerships for the Goals** | Platform designed for replication and partnership |

> **📖 For partner management, funding commitments, and allocation rules, see [Partner Funding Module](./PARTNER_FUNDING.md).**

---

## 25. Scalability & Replication

Impact OS is designed to:

- ✅ Run without founders
- ✅ Be partner-operated (NGOs, governments, universities)
- ✅ Be audited by funders
- ✅ Be replicated across regions

### Why It Scales

| Factor | Design |
|--------|--------|
| Rules are explicit | No interpretation needed |
| Enforcement is automated | AI + rules engine carries the burden |
| Outcomes are verifiable | Income is the proof |
| Human roles are bounded | Mentors teach, admins govern, system enforces |

> **📖 For deployment architecture, service responsibilities, and operational guidance, see [Infrastructure Module](./INFRASTRUCTURE.md).**

## 27. Assessment-Driven Offers

### Core Principle

> **The intake assessment determines not just admission—but the entire 90-day journey.**

Every admitted applicant receives a personalized offer based on their Skill Triad scores, current income status, and identified gaps.

### Skill Triad Calculation

The Skill Triad is computed from intake probe responses:

| Triad Axis | Input Sources |
|------------|---------------|
| **Technical** | Technical probe quality, prior skill learning attempts, skill track |
| **Soft** | Commitment probe, exposure probe, writing quality |
| **Commercial** | Commercial probe, prior earning attempts, current income |

```
        TECHNICAL (0-100)
            /\
           /  \
          /    \
         /      \
        /________\
   SOFT           COMMERCIAL
  (0-100)           (0-100)
```

### Offer Types Defined

| Offer Type | Profile | Stipend | Primary Focus |
|------------|---------|---------|---------------|
| **FULL_SUPPORT** | No income, low-mid skill | ✅ Yes | Technical + Commercial |
| **SKILLS_ONLY** | Has income, needs skills | ❌ No | Technical training |
| **ACCELERATOR** | Has skill, needs exposure | ❌ No | Arena Points focus |
| **CATALYST_TRACK** | Ready to earn | ❌ No | Income verification |

### Stipend Eligibility Rules

```python
def receives_stipend(applicant):
    # Only FULL_SUPPORT receives stipend
    if applicant.offer_type != "FULL_SUPPORT":
        return False
    
    # Must have no current income
    if applicant.current_monthly_income > 0:
        return False
    
    # Must have qualifying status
    qualifying = ["UNEMPLOYED", "UNDEREMPLOYED", "CAREGIVER", "STUDENT"]
    if applicant.current_status not in qualifying:
        return False
    
    return True
```

> **Not all participants receive monetary stipends.** Stipends are reserved for those with zero income AND eligible employment status.

### Primary Focus Assignment

The **lowest Skill Triad axis** becomes the primary focus:

- If Commercial is lowest → Mission priority: Arena Points
- If Technical is lowest → Mission priority: Skill XP
- If Soft is lowest → Mission priority: Communication challenges

### KPI Targets by Offer Type

| KPI | FULL_SUPPORT | SKILLS_ONLY | ACCELERATOR | CATALYST |
|-----|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Daily momentum | ≥50 required | ≥50 required | ≥50 required | ≥50 required |
| Weekly Skill XP | 100 XP | 150 XP | 50 XP | Optional |
| Weekly Arena Pts | 20 pts | 30 pts | 50 pts | 50 pts |
| Income target | ₦Any by D60 | Optional | ₦10k by D60 | ₦30k by D45 |
| Graduation | 90 days | 90 days | First client | 3+ clients |

### Offer Email Content

When an applicant is admitted, they receive an offer email containing:

1. **Skill Triad Visualization** — Their starting position
2. **Identified Gap** — "You're strong in [X] but need [Y] development"
3. **Offer Type** — What support they'll receive
4. **Stipend Status** — Whether they qualify for monetary support
5. **90-Day Focus** — What success looks like for their track
6. **KPI Preview** — The specific targets they'll be measured against
7. **Accept/Decline CTA** — Accepting locks in their journey
